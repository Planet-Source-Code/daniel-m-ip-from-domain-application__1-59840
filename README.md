### Description

Retrieves IP Address from domain name by querying a DNS Server using NS Lookup. Application "waits" until command prompt is closed before opening results file by using the FindWindow API. Results are added to a listbox and Internet Explorer can be shelled when an address is found. Code is commented.
 
### More Info
 
Must make sure all command prompts are closed when using application otherwise application will stall until closed because it checks if ANY command prompts are open.
